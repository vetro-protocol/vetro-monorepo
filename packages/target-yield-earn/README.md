# @vetro-protocol/target-yield-earn

Vetro Protocol target-yield earning vault actions for viem clients. The vault is an epoch-based ERC-7540 async vault over a pegged token (`VUSDx` over `VUSD` being the first instance): each epoch is a fixed term carrying a target yield, not a guaranteed return.

## Installation

```sh
npm add @vetro-protocol/target-yield-earn viem
```

## Overview

- Deposits and redemptions are asynchronous following ERC-7540.
- The vault runs in epochs. Each epoch is a term with its own target APR, a max deposit cap, and an exit window at its end during which redeem requests are accepted. `getEpochId` returns the current epoch (`0n` when none has started yet).
- The APR is a target, not a promise. It's set per epoch before that epoch starts and applies only to that term — nothing commits the vault to it beyond the current epoch — and the owner can terminate the vault once an epoch ends, after which yield stops accruing for good.
- `minEpochDurationSeconds`, `minExitWindowSeconds` and `maxExitWindowSeconds` mirror the vault's hardcoded values. They're exported as seconds.

## Usage

```ts
import {
  getEpoch,
  getEpochId,
  getMaxRequestDeposit,
  getMaxRequestRedeem,
  pendingDepositRequest,
} from "@vetro-protocol/target-yield-earn/actions";
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { hemi } from "viem/chains";

const publicClient = createPublicClient({ chain: hemi, transport: http() });

const vaultAddress = "0x...";

// Current epoch, or 0n if the vault hasn't started one yet.
const epochId = await getEpochId(publicClient, { address: vaultAddress });

// Full epoch: rate, deposit cap and windows as absolute timestamps.
const epoch = await getEpoch(publicClient, { address: vaultAddress, epochId });

// Max amount of assets this controller can still request for deposit.
const maxAssets = await getMaxRequestDeposit(publicClient, {
  address: vaultAddress,
  controller: "0x...",
});

// Max amount of shares this owner can still request for redemption.
const maxShares = await getMaxRequestRedeem(publicClient, {
  address: vaultAddress,
  owner: "0x...",
});

// Assets requested for deposit that the keeper hasn't fulfilled yet.
const pendingAssets = await pendingDepositRequest(publicClient, {
  address: vaultAddress,
  controller: "0x...",
  requestId: 0n,
});
```

## API

- Public actions (reads):
  - `getEpoch(client, params)` — an epoch's `start`, `end`, `rate`, `maxDeposits` (the deposit cap), `deposits` (the assets requested so far) and its `entryWindow`, `accrualInterval` and `exitWindow` as `{ end, start }` absolute timestamps.
  - `getEpochId(client, params)` — the current epoch id, `0n` when no epoch has started.
  - `getIsPaused(client, params)` — whether the keeper paused the vault. Pausing blocks new deposit requests only.
  - `getIsShutdown(client, params)` — whether the owner shut the vault down. Shutdown blocks every request and claim, but not cancellations. Reversible.
  - `getIsTerminated(client, params)` — whether the vault was permanently wound down. Once terminated, no new epochs or deposits, and withdrawal requests are claimable right away.
  - `getMaxRequestDeposit(client, params)` — the assets the controller can still request for deposit, capped by the epoch's remaining deposit capacity. `0n` whenever a deposit request would revert — outside the entry window, while paused, shutdown or terminated, or when the controller has a pending request from an earlier epoch.
  - `getMaxRequestRedeem(client, params)` — the shares the owner can still request for redemption. `0n` whenever a redeem request would revert — outside the exit window, while shutdown, or when a redeem batch from an earlier epoch is still pending and the vault hasn't terminated.
  - `getRate(client, params)` — the fixed rate an epoch pays during its accrual interval, WAD-scaled per annum. It returns the same value at any time, so use it (or `getEpoch`) to show the rate.
  - `pendingDepositRequest(client, params)` — assets in an unfulfilled deposit request, re-exported from `viem-erc7540`.
- Wallet actions (writes), exported from `/actions` only. The cancel actions return `{ emitter, promise }`:
  - `cancelDepositRequest(walletClient, { address, controller })` — cancels the controller's unfulfilled deposit request. The vault sends the assets back to the controller. Allowed at any time before fulfillment.
  - `cancelRedeemRequest(walletClient, { address, controller })` — cancels the controller's unfulfilled redeem request. The vault sends the escrowed shares back to the controller. Allowed only during the exit window of the epoch of the request.
  - Both cancel actions are specific to VUSDx. ERC-8416 does not define them.
  - `encodeCancelDepositRequest(params)` and `encodeCancelRedeemRequest(params)` — return the calldata for the cancel call without sending anything. Useful for gas estimation or for batching into a multicall.
  - `requestDeposit(walletClient, { address, assets, controller, owner })` — requests a deposit, re-exported from `viem-erc7540`. It returns the transaction hash. The caller must approve the pegged token first.
  - `requestRedeem(walletClient, { address, controller, owner, shares })` — requests a redemption, re-exported from `viem-erc7540`. It returns the transaction hash.
- `targetYieldEarnPublicActions()` — viem extension factory that wires the public actions onto a client via `.extend()`.
- `targetYieldEarnVaultAbi` — the minimal ABI subset used by the package.
- Constants: `maxExitWindowSeconds`, `minEpochDurationSeconds`, `minExitWindowSeconds`.
