`vetro-cli` — a command-line interface that sits on top of the `@vetro-protocol/*` packages so agents and users can read Vetro state and generate transaction calldata.

## Local development

Run it straight from the source, with no build step:

```sh
node packages/cli/src/cli.ts swap pegged-token --gateway 0x...
```

To run the bundled bin instead:

```sh
pnpm --filter @vetro-protocol/cli bundle   # produces _esm/cli.js (the vetro-cli bin)
node packages/cli/_esm/cli.js swap pegged-token --gateway 0x...
```

The `@vetro-protocol/*` packages are external to that bundle, and inside the monorepo they resolve to workspace source, so this exercises the bundled entrypoint rather than what an npm consumer gets. To check that, pack the tarball and install it in a scratch project.

## Configuration

`--rpc-url <url>` is a global option, accepted anywhere on the command line — before or after the subcommand:

```sh
vetro-cli --rpc-url https://my-node.example swap treasury --gateway 0x...
vetro-cli swap treasury --gateway 0x... --rpc-url https://my-node.example
```

It sets the endpoint every read goes to, and therefore the chain the emitted calldata is stamped with. It also accepts the endpoint via env var, so the resolution order is:

1. `--rpc-url`
2. `RPC_URL`
3. a public Ethereum mainnet RPC (viem's default for mainnet)

Only `http`/`https` endpoints are accepted; anything else is rejected as a usage error before any request is made.

### Supported chains

Vetro is deployed on Ethereum mainnet only, so every command starts by reading the endpoint's `eth_chainId` and fails if it is anything other than:

| Chain ID | Endpoint                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `1`      | Ethereum mainnet                   |
| `31337`  | local fork (anvil/Hardhat default) |

The check runs before any contract read, so pointing at another network fails fast rather than returning state read off the wrong chain. This restriction is temporary and lifts once Vetro is deployed on more chains.

## Output

Successful output is JSON on stdout, so it's directly consumable by an agent.

- Addresses and other strings are emitted as JSON strings; booleans as JSON booleans.
- `uint256` on-chain values are serialized as decimal strings, since `bigint` can't be represented in JSON.

Failures always exit non-zero, but come in two shapes:

- **Runtime errors** (RPC failure, contract revert) are JSON on stderr: `{ "error": "..." }`.
- **Usage errors** (invalid or missing flags, unknown commands) are written by the CLI parser as plain text on stderr.

### Write operations

Write commands touch no keys — they emit a JSON-RPC transaction request and the consumer signs and broadcasts it:

```json
{ "chainId": "0x1", "data": "0x8b6099db…", "to": "0x…gateway", "value": "0x0" }
```

Every numeric field is a hex `QUANTITY`, so the object can be lifted straight into `eth_sendTransaction` or an [ERC-5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792) `wallet_sendCalls` batch. `value` is always `"0x0"`.

## Token arguments

`--token`, `--from` and `--to` accept either a **symbol** (case-insensitive, e.g. `USDT`) or an **address**. `--from` is the token the operation spends, so it is whitelisted-only on `mint` and pegged-only on `send-to-queue`. `--to` is the token the operation pays out, so it is pegged on `mint` and whitelisted-only on `preview-redeem` and `redeem`. `--token` takes either side.

Because a token belongs to exactly one gateway, the gateway is inferred from the token and never passed explicitly. For the same reason `swap mint --to` is optional — the pegged token is whatever that gateway mints.

`--amount` is in human units of the token the operation spends. Its decimals come from `--from` or `--token` when the command takes one. On `preview-redeem` and `redeem` the spent token is the pegged token of the gateway inferred from `--to`, so the decimals come from that pegged token, not from `--to`.

To discover the symbols a gateway takes, run `swap whitelisted-tokens --gateway <addr>` — a gateway-level read, so it takes the gateway explicitly instead of inferring it from a token.

| `vetro-cli swap approve --token <tok> --amount <n>`                                                   | `encodeApproveData`   | Approves the inferred gateway to spend the token — a whitelisted token to `mint`, or a pegged token to `send-to-queue` or to redeem in one step. Prepend it when the allowance is short.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `vetro-cli swap mint --from <tok> [--to <tok>] --amount <n> --receiver <addr> [--slippage <percent>]` | `encodeDeposit`       | Swap-in. `--slippage` is a percent off `previewDeposit`, in `[0, 100]` with at most one decimal (e.g. `0.5`); **it defaults to `0`**, so `minPeggedTokenOut` is the full previewed amount unless a tolerance is given. Fails when the previewed output is above `maxMint`, the gateway's remaining mint capacity, or when the treasury has deposits paused for the token (`tokenConfig.depositActive` is false) — the deposit would revert. |
| `vetro-cli swap send-to-queue --from <tok> --amount <n>`                                              | `encodeRequestRedeem` | Swap-out step 1: locks the pegged token in the gateway and starts the cooldown. The token to redeem into is chosen at step 2, so it is not given here. A second request **adds to the open one and restarts the cooldown on the whole locked amount**, so queue the full amount at once. Fails when the gateway has the redeem queue disabled — the request would revert, and the redeem is one-step instead.                               |
| `vetro-cli swap redeem --to <tok> --amount <n> --receiver <addr> [--slippage <percent>]`              | `encodeRedeem`        | Swap-out: step 2 of the Redeem Queue, or the whole redeem when it is one step. `--slippage` works as on `mint`. Fails when the payout is 0, above the treasury reserves, or when withdrawals are paused for the token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Swapping in

```sh
vetro-cli swap allowance --token USDT --account 0xAgent   # "0" → approval needed
vetro-cli swap approve --token USDT --amount 100          # sign + broadcast
vetro-cli swap mint --from USDT --amount 100 --receiver 0xAgent --slippage 0.5
```

### Swapping out, step 1

```sh
vetro-cli swap allowance --token VUSD --account 0xAgent   # "0" → approval needed
vetro-cli swap approve --token VUSD --amount 100          # sign + broadcast
vetro-cli swap send-to-queue --from VUSD --amount 100
```

`send-to-queue` fails on its own when the queue is off, so no preflight read is needed. To read the cooldown itself, `swap cooldown` takes `--gateway`, and the gateway address is the `to` of any write command's output. `swap cooldown` is gateway-wide, so it does not tell you whether _your_ address skips the queue: `swap is-instant-redeem --account <addr> --gateway <addr>` reads that per-account. When it returns `true`, skip `send-to-queue` — the redeem is one step.

To follow the cooldown, run `swap request --account <addr> --gateway <addr>`. Its `status` changes from `cooldown` to `ready` when the request can be redeemed.

### Swapping out, step 2

When `swap request` shows `ready`, redeem the locked amount:

```sh
vetro-cli swap redeem --to USDT --amount 100 --receiver 0xAgent --slippage 0.5
```

### Swapping out in one step

When the queue is off for your address, skip `send-to-queue`. Approve the pegged token, then redeem:

```sh
vetro-cli swap approve --token VUSD --amount 100
vetro-cli swap redeem --to USDT --amount 100 --receiver 0xAgent --slippage 0.5
```
