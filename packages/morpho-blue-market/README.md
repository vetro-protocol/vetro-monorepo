# @vetro-protocol/morpho-blue-market

Morpho Blue market actions for viem clients. Wraps a single Morpho Blue market — supply collateral, borrow, repay and withdraw — behind the market id, so callers never assemble `MarketParams` themselves.

## Installation

```sh
pnpm add @vetro-protocol/morpho-blue-market viem
```

## Overview

- Every action takes the Morpho Blue contract `address` plus the `marketId`; the market's `MarketParams` struct is read on-chain from `idToMarketParams` and passed to the contract call.
- Writes emit their progress through an `EventEmitter` and return `{ emitter, promise }`.
- `supplyCollateral` and `repayAssets` handle the ERC-20 approval themselves: they read the current allowance — of the collateral token and the loan token respectively — and approve only when it falls short. `approveAmount` defaults to `amount`; pass a larger value to approve once for several operations.
- `supplyCollateralAndBorrow` runs both steps against one emitter and skips the borrow if the supply doesn't succeed. Its event map is the union of both, with a single `supply-collateral-and-borrow-settled` at the end.
- The `encode*` helpers return the calldata for their contract call without sending anything — useful for gas estimation or for batching into a multicall. They take `marketParams` directly, since there is no client to read them with.

## Usage

```ts
import { getMarketParams } from "@vetro-protocol/morpho-blue-market";
import { supplyCollateralAndBorrow } from "@vetro-protocol/morpho-blue-market/actions";
import { createPublicClient, createWalletClient, custom, http } from "viem";
import { mainnet } from "viem/chains";

const publicClient = createPublicClient({ chain: mainnet, transport: http() });
const walletClient = createWalletClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: custom(window.ethereum),
});

const morphoAddress = "0x...";
const marketId = "0x...";

// Collateral token, loan token, oracle, IRM and LLTV of the market.
const marketParams = await getMarketParams({
  address: morphoAddress,
  client: publicClient,
  marketId,
});

// Supply collateral and borrow against it in one flow (approval included).
const { emitter, promise } = supplyCollateralAndBorrow(walletClient, {
  address: morphoAddress,
  borrowAmount: 500_000_000_000_000_000_000n,
  collateralAmount: 1_000_000_000_000_000_000n,
  marketId,
  onBehalf: "0x...",
  receiver: "0x...",
});

emitter.on("user-signed-supply-collateral", (hash) =>
  console.log("supply tx:", hash),
);
emitter.on("borrow-assets-transaction-succeeded", (receipt) =>
  console.log("borrowed:", receipt),
);

await promise;
```

The same actions are also available via `.extend()` factories (`morphoBluePublicActions()`, `morphoBlueWalletActions()`) for callers who prefer viem's extension pattern.

## API

From `@vetro-protocol/morpho-blue-market/actions`:

- Public actions (reads):
  - `getMarketParams({ address, client, marketId })` — the market's `MarketParams`: `collateralToken`, `irm`, `lltv`, `loanToken` and `oracle`.
- Wallet actions (writes): `borrowAssets`, `repayAssets`, `supplyCollateral`, `supplyCollateralAndBorrow`, `withdrawCollateral`. Each is called as `action(walletClient, params)` and returns `{ emitter, promise }`.
- Calldata encoders: `encodeBorrowAssets`, `encodeRepayAssets`, `encodeSupplyCollateral`, `encodeWithdrawCollateral`.

From `@vetro-protocol/morpho-blue-market`:

- `getMarketParams` — the same read, also exported from the root.
- `morphoBluePublicActions()` / `morphoBlueWalletActions()` — viem extension factories that wire the same actions onto a client via `.extend()`.
- `morphoBlueAbi` — the minimal ABI subset used by the package.
- Types: `BorrowAssetsEvents`, `MarketParams`, `RepayAssetsEvents`, `SupplyCollateralAndBorrowEvents`, `SupplyCollateralEvents`, `WithdrawCollateralEvents`.
